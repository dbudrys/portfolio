														Experience is defined as practical contact with, and observation of facts or events.
														Success is defined as the accomplishment of an aim or purpose. From High School, to Austin Peay,
														 to Graduate School I have acquired what success truly means.
														 To be successful means that regardless of the outcome,
														 you learn something new and look for opportunities to apply what knowledge has been acquired.
														 My experiences have taught me that in order to have a clear view of success you have to be familiar with failure.
														  Being a basketball player for over half my life meant that I faced a lot of failure.
															Without those times of failure I never would have known the success of getting a Division 1 scholarship to play a sport that I love.
															Without my struggles in exploring different majors I never would have found my passion for Computer Science.
															Failure has a negative connotation to it and so many people fear that word that they miss taking a chance and discovering their true potential.
															I am thankful for my athletic background and being surrounded by friends that push me to take risks and challenges
															because failure was never something I was afraid of but embraced.
